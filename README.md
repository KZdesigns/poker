# Poker

## Learning Goals
- Be able to define desired functionality, write specs, and then implement
- Know how to follow red, green, refactor TDD workflow
- Know how to create and use test doubles
- Know when to use context and describe

## Rules
- Each player is dealt five cards.
- Players bet; each player may fold, see the current bet, or raise.
- In turn, each player can choose to discard up to three cards.
- They are dealt new cards from the deck to replace their old cards.
- Players bet again.
- If any players do not fold, then players reveal their hands; strongest hand wins the pot.

## Design
### Classes you will want:
#### Card
#### Deck
#### Hand
- The logic of calculating pair, three-of-a-kind, two-pair, etc. goes here.
- Logic of which hand beats which would go here.
#### Player

- Player has methods to ask the user:
- Which cards they wish to discard
- Whether they wish to fold, see, or raise.
